I hold a Herchel Smith Fellowship at the University of Cambridge and
a member of the Gallop Lab at the Wellcome Trust / Cancer Research UK Gurdon
Institute, studying the growth and regulation of filopodia, finger-like
protrusions from cell membranes. I work on the application of statistical
physics to do computational modelling and analysis of large, experimentally
generated data sets, in order to understand features of the actin cytoskeleton.
